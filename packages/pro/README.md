# VBA MCP Server Pro

Professional MCP server for VBA extraction, analysis, and modification.

**Version 0.4.0** - Production Ready 🚀

## What's New in v0.4.0

**Major Reliability Improvements** - Three critical problems resolved:

✅ **Verified Injections** - Post-save verification ensures modules actually exist after injection (no more false positives)

✅ **Automated Macro Execution** - Injected macros now execute without manual security prompts via `AutomationSecurityContext`

✅ **No File Corruption** - Session-based injection eliminates corruption from multiple injections

**Score:** 6/10 → **9/10 (Production Ready)**

[See detailed changelog](CHANGELOG.md#040---2025-12-15)

"Close budget.xlsm and save changes"

### VBA Validation & Injection (with Verification)
"Validate this VBA code before injecting: Sub Test()..."
"List all macros in budget.xlsm"
"Update the CalculateTotal function in budget.xlsm with this new code..."  # Auto-verified

**Note:** All injections now include post-save verification. Output includes `"verified": True` when successful.
